Finally started learning web-dev with the Odin Project.
Although this is technically not my first website as I have tried learnig web-dev earlier, but that was a few years ago and I have forgotten almost everything.
So excited to see how I will be able to make it beautiful and flashy as I progress through the curriculum.

For now, this project is made to demonstrate basic html skills such as understanding,
boiler plate,
how links work,
how images are embedded,
headings and where to use them(sematically),
and how to link different pages of a website.

Excited for the journey ahead ðŸ˜„.
